# Contributing to React-Leaflet-Geoman

Thank you for your interest in contributing to React-Leaflet-Geoman! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm 8+
- Git
- Basic knowledge of React, TypeScript, and Leaflet

### Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-leaflet-geoman.git
   cd react-leaflet-geoman
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development mode**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Run the example app**
   ```bash
   npm run example:dev
   ```

## üß™ Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Tests should be placed in `src/**/__tests__/` directories
- Use descriptive test names that explain the expected behavior
- Test both success and error cases
- Mock external dependencies (Leaflet, Geoman)
- Aim for high test coverage

### Test Structure
```typescript
describe('ComponentName', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    // Cleanup
  });

  it('should do something specific', () => {
    // Test implementation
  });
});
```

## üìù Code Style

### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Provide proper type annotations
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Avoid `any` type when possible
- Use union types for better type safety

### React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React best practices
- Use proper prop types and interfaces
- Implement proper cleanup in useEffect

### General
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Write clear, descriptive comments
- Keep functions small and focused
- Follow the existing code style

### Linting
```bash
# Check for linting issues
npm run lint

# Fix auto-fixable issues
npm run lint:fix
```

## üîß Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Feature Branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### 2. Make Your Changes
- Write your code following the style guidelines
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation if needed

### 3. Test Your Changes
```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run lint
npm test
npm run build
```

### 4. Run the Example App
```bash
npm run example:dev
```
Test your changes in the example app to ensure they work correctly.

### 5. Commit Your Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add new feature description"
```

Use conventional commit messages:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for formatting changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

### 6. Push and Create a Pull Request
```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## üìö Documentation

### Updating Documentation
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add JSDoc comments for new functions/components
- Update type definitions in index.ts
- Add examples for new features

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples
- Provide TypeScript types
- Add links to relevant resources
